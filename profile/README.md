## Introduction

Airstack is a developer platform that makes it easy to integrate web3 data into any application. Our mission is to be the most developer-friendly platform for web3 integration. Please join our Dev Chat https://t.me/+uW6ypo49TcZmMGEx and challenge us with your use cases, questions and needs. Your success is our #1 priority.

Airstack is the easiest way to search and get APIs for onchain data across chains and dapps.
With Airstack you can literally integrate everything! Data APIs: ERC6551, ERC721, ERC1155, ERC20, Lens, Farcaster, POAP, XMTP, more...

🤖 The Airstack AI engine 🤖 enables you to query with natural language (e.g. “show me all tokens held by Vitalik.eth, images of his NFTs, and his Lens and Farcaster usernames”) — a great way to get started learning the APIs!

🆕 ERC-6551 -- you can now use Airstack to query all details about ERC-6551 token bound accounts and the assets they hold!

🆕 XMTP -- you can now use Airstack to query if a wallet or social account has XMTP!

🔥 Web3 Identity Resolvers -- Query across ENS, Lens, Farcaster, POAPs and NFTs with a single Airstack query/response. Build the future of web3 social interoperability and recommendation engines with Airstack.

👩‍💻 Projects building with Airstack include XMTP, Lens, Farcaster, ERC-6551, CRM, marketing engines, ad platforms, portfolio balancers, ZK attestations, Farcaster, decentralized social, messaging apps, wallets, token-gated membership solutions, data visualization, and more. What will you build?
